# Finding hidden pictures
---
### There's nothing like finding a wrong picture when you're bored. 
### But if we don't find the wrong picture, we may feel bad. 
### If you use this, you can find the wrong picture right away.



## **key point**
1. Compare the two images and find the wrong pictures.
2. In addition to the game of finding the wrong picture, it can be useful when we actually look for different situations from the past (for example, when viewed on CCTV).



# Requirements: (with versions)
---
python(3.9.12)
opencv(4.6.0)

#### Compare the two pictures to find the wrong part. 

#### Step First, A notice for finding the wrong picture appears.

#### Step Fourth, When the search for the wrong picture is over, an end window appears, and a window for evaluation also appears.
